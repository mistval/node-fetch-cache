# node-fetch-cache

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/mistval/node-fetch-cache/graph/badge.svg?token=UYA5PDNZ0J)](https://codecov.io/github/mistval/node-fetch-cache) ![workflow status](https://github.com/mistval/node-fetch-cache/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

[node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) with caching of responses.

The first fetch with any given arguments will result in an HTTP request and any subsequent fetch with the same arguments will read the response from the cache.

By default responses are cached in memory, but you can also cache to files on disk, cache in Redis, or implement your own cache.

## Usage

Import it and use it the same way you would use [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch):

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch-cache';

const response = await fetch('http://google.com');
console.log(await response.text());
```

The next time you `fetch('http://google.com')`, the response will be returned from the cache. No HTTP request will be made.

## Basic API

This module's API is a superset of `node-fetch`'s. You can consult [the node-fetch documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) for its general usage. Only the additional caching features provided by node-fetch-cache are discussed below.

### Control what's cached

By default node-fetch-cache caches all responses, regardless of the response status or any other response characteristics.

There are two main ways to customize which responses are cached and which are not.

By `create()`ing a custom fetch instance:

```js
import NodeFetchCache from 'node-fetch-cache';

const fetch = NodeFetchCache.create({
  // Only cache responses with a 2xx status code
  shouldCacheResponse: (response) => response.ok,
});

const response = await fetch('http://google.com')
console.log(await response.text());
```

Or by passing options to `fetch()` when making a request:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch-cache';

const response = await fetch(
  'http://google.com',
  undefined,
  {
    // Only cache responses with a 2xx status code
    shouldCacheResponse: (response) => response.ok,
  },
);

console.log(await response.text());
```

If you provide options in both ways, then the options are merged together, with those passed to `fetch()` taking precedence.

### Cache to Disk

By default responses are cached in memory, but you can also cache to files on disk. This allows the cache to survive the process exiting, allows multiple processes to share the same cache, and may reduce memory usage.

Use the `FileSystemCache` class like so:

```js
import NodeFetchCache, { FileSystemCache } from 'node-fetch-cache';

const fetch = NodeFetchCache.create({
  cache: new FileSystemCache(options),
});
```

Options:

```js
{
  // Specify where to keep the cache. If undefined, '.cache' is used by default.
  // If this directory does not exist, it will be created.
  cacheDirectory: '/my/cache/directory/path',
  // Time to live. How long (in ms) responses remain cached before being
  // automatically ejected. If undefined, responses are never
  // automatically ejected from the cache.
  ttl: 1000,
}

```
### Cache with Redis

Use the [@node-fetch-cache/redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@node-fetch-cache/redis) package to cache in Redis.

### Cache in Memory with a TTL

If you would like to cache in memory and automatically eject responses after a certain amount of time (in ms), you can create a custom instance of the `MemoryCache` class and use that:

```js
import NodeFetchCache, { MemoryCache } from 'node-fetch-cache';

const fetch = NodeFetchCache.create({
  cache: new MemoryCache({ ttl: 1000 })
});
```

Note that the default cache is a globally shared instance of `MemoryCache` with no TTL.

### Implement your Own Cache

If none of the existing caching options meet your needs, you can implement your own cache. You can use any object that implements the following interface:

```ts
type INodeFetchCacheCache = {
  get(key: string): Promise<{
    bodyStream: NodeJS.ReadableStream;
    metaData: NFCResponseMetadata;
  } | undefined>;
  set(
    key: string,
    bodyStream: NodeJS.ReadableStream,
    metaData: NFCResponseMetadata
  ): Promise<{
    bodyStream: NodeJS.ReadableStream;
    metaData: NFCResponseMetadata;
  }>;
  remove(key: string): Promise<void | unknown>;
};
```

The `set()` function must accept a key (which will be a string), a response body stream, and a metadata object (which will be a JSON-serializable JS object). It should store these in such a way that the cache instance can return them later via the `get()` function. The `set()` function should return the same metadata that was passed in and a *new, unread* body stream with the same content as the stream that was passed in.

The `get()` function should return the cached body and metadata that had been set via the `set()` function, or `undefined` if no cached value is found.

The `remove()` function should remove the cached value associated with the given key, if any.

You may bend the rules and implement certain types of custom cache control logic in your custom cache if you'd like to. Specifically:
1. Your cache may choose to remove values from the cache arbitrarily (for example if you want to implement a TTL option like `MemoryCache` and `FileSystemCache` do).
2. Your cache may choose not to honor `set()` operations. For example, if you want to implement a cache that only caches responses that have a 2xx status code, your `set()` function could choose to discard responses with other status codes without inserting them into the cache.
3. It is not strictly necessary for `get()` to return the exact same data that was passed to `set()`. For example `get()` could return a custom header in the metadata with the number of times that the response has been read from the cache.

You can reference the implementations of [MemoryCache](./src/classes/caching/memory_cache.ts) and [FileSystemCache](./src/classes/caching/file_system_cache.ts) for examples.

### Cache-Control: only-if-cached

The HTTP standard describes a [Cache-Control request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#request_directives) to control aspects of cache behavior. Node-fetch ignores these, but node-fetch-cache respects the `Cache-Control: only-if-cached` directive. When `only-if-cached` is specified, node-fetch-cache will return a `504 Gateway Timeout` response with an `isCacheMiss` property if there is no cached response that can be returned. No HTTP request will be made. For example:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch-cache';

const response = await fetch('https://google.com', {
  headers: { 'Cache-Control': 'only-if-cached' }
});

if (response.isCacheMiss) {
  console.log('No response was found in the cache!');
}
```

## Advanced API

### Custom Cache Key Function

You can provide custom cache key generation logic to node-fetch-cache by passing a `calculateCacheKey` option to `create()`:

```js
import NodeFetchCache, { CACHE_VERSION } from 'node-fetch-cache';

const fetch = NodeFetchCache.create({
  calculateCacheKey: (url, options) => {
    return JSON.stringify([url, CACHE_VERSION]);
  },
});
```

In the above example, all requests to a given URL will hash to the same cache key, so only the very first request with that URL will result in an HTTP request and all subsequent requests will read the response from the cache, even if they have completely different headers, bodies, etc.

It is wise to include `CACHE_VERSION` as part of the cache key so that when node-fetch-cache has backwards-incomptible changes in storage format, the obsolete cache entries will be automatically abandoned.

### Built-In Cache Key Function

node-fetch-cache exports a `calculateCacheKey()` function which is the default function used to calculate a cache key string from request parameters. It may be useful for enabling some advanced use cases (especially if you want to call cache functions directly). Call `calculateCacheKey()` exactly like you would call `fetch()`:

```js
import NodeFetchCache, {
  MemoryCache,
  calculateCacheKey
} from 'node-fetch-cache';

const cache = new MemoryCache();
const fetch = NodeFetchCache.create({ cache });
const rawCacheData = await cache.get(calculateCacheKey('https://google.com'));
```

### Eject responses from the cache

Responses from node-fetch-cache have an `ejectFromCache()` method that can be used to eject the response from the cache, so that the next request will perform a true HTTP request rather than returning a cached response. This may be useful for more advanced use cases where you want to dynamically remove a response from the cache at some later time:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch-cache';

const response = await fetch('http://google.com');

// Your code...

await response.ejectFromCache();
```

### Request Synchronization Strategy

You might wonder if making the same request many times simultaneously might result in many concurrent HTTP requests as they all miss the cache at the same time. For example:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch-cache';

const responses = await Promise.all(
  Array(100).fill().map(() => fetch('https://google.com')),
);

const fromCache = responses.filter(r => r.returnedFromCache);
console.log('Number of responses served from the cache:', fromCache.length);
```

This depends on the request synchronization strategy used. By default, if you're using `MemoryCache`, or you're using `FileSystemCache` and *not sharing the cache among multiple processes*, then the answer is no. Only one HTTP request will be made and the other 99 requests will read the response from the cache. This is thanks to the default `LockoSynchronizationStrategy` which provides efficient in-process synchronization.

You can provide your own synchronization strategy and you may wish to do so if you need to synchronize requests among multiple processes (potentially across multiple physical hosts). A custom synchronization strategy should implement the `ISynchronizationStrategy` interface:

```ts
type ISynchronizationStrategy = {
  doWithExclusiveLock<TReturnType>(
    key: string,
    action: () => Promise<TReturnType>,
  ): Promise<TReturnType>;
};
```

And it should ensure that for any given `key`, `action`s are queued and are not executed in parallel.

You can provide a custom synchronization strategy the same way you provide other options:

```js
const fetch = NodeFetchCache.create({
  cache: new FileSystemCache(options),
  synchronizationStrategy: new MySynchronizationStrategy(),
});
```

## Misc

### Streams

node-fetch-cache does not support `Stream` request bodies, except for `fs.ReadStream`. And when using `fs.ReadStream`, the cache key is generated based only on the path of the stream, not its content. That means if you stream `/my/desktop/image.png` twice, you will get a cached response the second time, **even if the content of image.png has changed**.

Streams don't quite play nice with the concept of caching based on request characteristics, because we would have to read the stream to the end to find out what's in it and hash it into a proper cache key.

### CommonJS

node-fetch-cache supports both ESM and CommonJS. If you are using CommonJS, you can import it like so:

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch-cache');
```

### Upgrading

Upgrading from an older major version? Check the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/mistval/node-fetch-cache/tree/master/docs/upgrade_guide.md).

### Node.js Support Policy

node-fetch-cache will support:
* The current Node.js version
* All non-EOL LTS Node.js versions
* In addition, as far back as is technically easy

Currently the oldest supported Node.js version is v18.19.0.

Automated tests will be run on the current Node.js version, the oldest supported Node.js version, and the latest release of all even-numbered Node.js versions between those two.
